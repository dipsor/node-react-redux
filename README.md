# CODEX-API

## TODO Features
- dashboard, where you can define stubs, to create classes.

- if its php(laravel): it will be possible to define project name (will be used in namespace)

- folder structure, etc

- after we can generate .php files placed predefined folder structure.

- generated files can be:

- downloaded in zip file
- pushed to git pull request
- pulled from laravel packaged and installed in the project.
- these files and stubs will be saved in presets, which we can easily clone, change their name and generate new similar stubs.

- in the end, we can install multiple stubs in our project

- there could be also private and public stub libraries. so people could use already built stubs for their own projects.
